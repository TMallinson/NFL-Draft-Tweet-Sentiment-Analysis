# 2020 NFL Draft Sentiment from Fans

**Final project for CIS 731 - Programming Techniques for Data Science and Analytics**

This project will apply descriptive analytics and content analytics on keywords pertaining to Tweets regarding the 2020 NFL Draft. For the first time ever, the draft was held virtually due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. I want to see how fans reacted to the new structure and to the players that their favorite teams selected. I will scrape tweets using Tweepy and collect them using the cloud server PythonAnywhere. Tweet data will be analyzed by applying descriptive, content, and network analytics techniques using Python and PySpark. I will use a Naive Bayes classification algorithm to classify the text and sentiment analysis to record the feeling towards the results of the draft.
